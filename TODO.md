# Quality-of-life improvements

- [x] there should be a way to manually adjust the amount of times completed
  - id:49 and id:63 should only have `1` completion count
  - Added `caco beaten` command group: `caco beaten list`, `caco beaten add`, `caco beaten remove`, `caco beaten set`

- [x] change default sorting on list to id ascending
  - Default sort is now `id+` (ascending) when no sort specified

- [x] tag searches should support globs
  - e.g., `caco list --tag cacowards_2025*` should return items that contain `cacowards_2025_winner` and `cacowards_2025_runnerup`
- [x] tags should be shown when listing WADs
  - Configurable via `[list]` section in config.toml
- [x] tags should have completions
  - All `--tag` options now have shell completions that suggest existing tags

- [x] ALL search and list fields should be supported in ALL commands, always
  - Universal query support now works across all commands with `resolve_wad_query()`

- [x] when giving an error that multiple WADs match the search, default behavior should be to do an interactive picker to select which one the user wanted
  - Interactive picker uses fzf if available, falls back to numbered selection

- [x] the map progress feature should only apply to WADs that are currently playing. when a WAD is marked as finished, its map progress should be archived and reset to 0
  - Implemented playthrough cycles: when status changes to `finished`, the cycle increments
  - Map completions are tracked per cycle; `caco map list` shows current cycle by default
  - Use `caco map list --all-cycles` to see completions from all playthroughs

- [x] there should be a way to view completion details and history
  - `caco beaten list` shows completion count for WADs
  - `caco info` displays times completed
  - Map completion history preserved across playthrough cycles

## I don't like the syntax for a lot of the commands
- [x] config
  - Config command simplified: `caco config` shows config, `caco config --edit` opens in $EDITOR
  - All configuration should be done through the config file

- [x] delete
  - Delete commands now show preview with stats before prompting
  - Supports `--dry-run` to see what would be deleted
  - Soft delete by default: WADs go to trash, use `caco restore` to recover
  - Use `--purge` for permanent deletion

- [x] import
  - Added `caco import auto` (aliased as `caco add`) for auto-detection:
    - Integer → idgames ID lookup
    - URL → URL import
    - Existing file path → local import
    - Text → idgames search

- [x] list
  - Configurable via `[list]` section in config.toml
  - Supports custom columns, colors, default sort
  - Added `--deleted` flag to view trash

- [x] play
  - Now uses universal query support with interactive picker
- [x] update
  - Now supports `--dry-run` to preview changes

## Configuration file
- [x] there should be a way to use the configuration file to specify the default formatting when listing WADs
  - Implemented as `[list]` section with `format`, `sort`, `colors` options

    - Consider: parse thread title for basic metadata?
    - Could even implement a call to an AI LLM to scrape the first post of the thread and fill in the relevant info?
      - what *is* the relevant info? what data are we actually trying to scrape?
        - title
        - author
        - date
        - description
        - other info...
          - complevel?
